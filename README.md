 This Final Year Project focuses on developing a comprehensive cybersecurity solution for
 phishing URL detection and malware analysis using hybrid approaches: signature-based
 matching and machine learning techniques. For phishing URL detection, the system
 implements a signature-based method that compares URLs against known phishing
 datasets, alongside a Random Forest-based machine learning model that analyzes 30
 distinct URL features to identify malicious sites with high accuracy. 
 The malware analysis component similarly employs a dual methodology, creating SHA-256 hashes of files
 for signature matching against malware databases while also utilizing Random Forest
 classification to detect malicious behavior patterns. The Random Forest algorithm was
 selected for both applications due to its proven effectiveness in cybersecurity tasks,
 demonstrated by its 95% accuracy in phishing detection and up to 95% accuracy in
 malware classification. 
 The system addresses critical gaps in current cybersecurity defenses by combining traditional signature-based methods with advanced machine learn
ing, providing robust protection against both known and emerging threats. This hybrid
 approach offers significant advan tages over standalone methods, particularly in detect
ing zero-day attacks and polymorphic malware that evade signature-based detection.
 The project contributes to the cybersecurity field by implementing these techniques in
 an integrated framework, validated against real-world datasets from PhishTank, Open
Phish, and malware repositories
